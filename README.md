# TestRespository

This is the lese moi file for the Test Respository, obviously.

```c#
private void TryToReadMe(string text, out bool gotRead)
{
  gotRead = false;
  if(text.Contains("readable"))
  {
    gotRead = true;
    DoTheReading(text);
  }
}
```

Now the above code isn't syntactically incorrect, at least.

# More to come...

## And even more after that.

Okay, this is round two of the editing process.
